You may do what you like with this tool - copy the code, use it any way you like, but ***I will not be held accountable for what you do with it***.<br>
This tool is meant to make it easier for people with slow internet, or who are fed up with Pearson's reader application.<br>
Having eBooks in PDF form is valuable for many people, and this tool makes it easy to reach that.<br>
