    <h1>How to combine your eBook pages into a PDF</h1>
    
    <h2>LibreOffice:</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have downloaded all pages of your eBook, you will be left with hundreds of PNG images.<br>
      I would recommend moving these images into their own folder/directory to make the following process easier.
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Open LibreOffice, and create a new "Impress" presentation. You can press cancel to any extra dialogue on startup.</li>
        <li>In the "Properties" panel (on the right-hand side of the screen by default), make sure the "Format" (or aspect
        ratio) and Orientation are correct.<br>When inserted, the images will not change the shape of the slide, so getting
        the aspect ratio right will make the quality of the final PDF much better.</li>
        <li>Go to Insert > Media > Photo Album</li>
        <li>Select "Add" in the popup window.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the folder/directory containing your images, and select all of them.<br>
        <b>Warning:</b> The images will not have a .png file extension when they are downloaded, so your file manager may not recognise them as images.
        If this is the case, change the displayed file type from "All Images" to "All Files" (bottom-right in Linux).</li>
        <li>Once you have selected/highlighted all the pages/images, select "Open".</li>
        <li>Now that you have added the images as an album, select "Insert Slides" in the popup window.
        This may take a very long time, depending on the speed of your computer. I'd recommend using Task Manager in Windows,
        or any process manager/resource monitor of your choice (such as Htop in Linux) to monitor LibreOffice.</li>
        <li>Once the process has completed, delete the first slide (which would have been created with the new presentation,
        and will not have an image on it). This can be achieved by simply right-clicking on it in the left panel and selecting "Delete".<br>
        Feel free to remove other pages/slides as you see fit.</li>
        <li>Finally, to export the presentation as a PDF, go to "File" > "Export As" > "Export Directly As PDF"</li>
        <li>Rename it to your desired name, choose a suitable save location, and select "Save".</li>
        <li>You can now close LibreOffice without saving, as you now have the presentation in PDF form.</li>
      </ol>
